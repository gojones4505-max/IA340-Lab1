(![explore-programs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc82ef16-5190-4614-b40d-9659b6344473)



This is my [IA340](https://catalog.jmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=50&coid=258336) python assignment.

## Course description

**Data mining** is the nontrivial extraction of previously unknown and potential useful information from (large) data sets to help explain current behaviors and anticipate future outcomes. Students will apply data mining and knowledge discovery methods to data sets from business, industry and government. The course is team oriented, project based and grounded in the relevant legal and ethical context.
This course is apart of the Intelligence Analysis program and James Madison University and must be taken only by IA students. **The only Prerequisite required is the IA 241 class.**
